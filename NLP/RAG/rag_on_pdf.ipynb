In the provided context, the encoder is described as follows: \\n\\n- The encoder is responsible for mapping an input sequence of symbol representations, denoted as (x1, ...) to a sequence of continuous representations. \\n- It uses stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers to process the input. \\n- The output of the encoder serves as the \"memory\" for the subsequent \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers. \\n- In the \"encoder-decoder attention\" mechanism, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, while the keys and values are provided by the output of the encoder. \\n\\nOverall, the encoder plays a vital role in transforming the input data into a format that the Transformer model can use for further processing and generating outputs.
